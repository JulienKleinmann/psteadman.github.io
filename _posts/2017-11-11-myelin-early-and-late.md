### How could sleep, aging and myelin be related?

Sometimes its good to get out of your wheelhouse.

Two posters presented today explored myelin modifications following different interventions. In the first, the effect of chronic sleep loss during adolescence was found to decrease the thickness of myelin in the Corpus Callosum and the Lateral Olfactory Tract. Adolescence is a key time for myelin development which continues in the human brain until our late 20s. 

This poster made me wonder what I did to my brain during those late nights I spent playing video games during my own adolescence? 

What is interesting about this finding on myelin in chronic sleep loss is that previous work showed the sleep loss suppressed myelin-related genes. Next steps should better characterize the role of sleep in laying down myelin to form circuits properly during adolescence.

The second poster moved from the young adolescence brain to the aged brain. This poster examined ERK1/2 activation in oligodendrocytes, which had previously been shown to [enhance myelination](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3711773/). As we age brain function decreases in many capacities including memory. Would sustained activation of ERK1/2 in oligodendrocytes affect cognitive decline? From a young age, mice had oligodendrocytes trigger sustained ERK1/2 signalling which persisted as long as the oligodendrocyte lived. Behaviorally this lead to an increase in freezing on a contextual fear conditioning task in aged mice only. It remains unclear how to interpret this finding. Since over time oligodendrocytes die with aging, could it be that those with sustained ERK1/2 activation survive longer, that in old age more persist to facilitate this behaviour? This work was preliminary and this will some of the next steps. 

Both these posters introduced me to new concepts on the shared topic of white matter in the brain. I can't wait to see what new info tomorrow brings!

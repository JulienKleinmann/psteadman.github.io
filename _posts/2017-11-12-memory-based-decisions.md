### Making decisions at #SfN17

How do we utilize our memories to influence decisions? Dr. Daphna Shohamy answered this question where she showed memory-influenced decisions utilized a hippocampal-striatal functional connection, whereas non-memory influenced decisions did not. 

Dr. Shohamy's lecture was enjoyable and clear. Through creative experiments she found the striatum, a structure known for habit formation and incremental learning represented often an 'average value' for a situation, as well as the hippocampus, known for its episodic focus and flexibility in memory, work together to influence decisions. She presented a series of data using inventive tasks demonstrating functional connectivity between these two regions was strong when a decision integrated information in a relational sense.

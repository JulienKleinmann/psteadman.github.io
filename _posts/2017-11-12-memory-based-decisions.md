### Making decisions at #SfN17

How do we utilize our memories to influence decisions? Dr. Daphna Shohamy answered this question where she showed decisions influenced by memories utilized a hippocampal-striatal relationship, whereas non-memory influenced decisions did not. 

In an enjoyable and clear lecture Dr. Shohamy examined how the striatum, a structure known for habit formation and incremental learning represented often an 'average value' for a situation, as well as the hippocampus, known for its episodic focus and flexibility in memory, work together to influence decisions. She presented a series of data using creative tasks that show functional connectivity is strong between these structures when a decision integrates information in a relational sense.

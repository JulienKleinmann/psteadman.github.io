### Making decisions at #SfN17

How do we utilize our memories to influence decisions? Dr. Daphna Shohamy answered this question where she showed memory-influenced decisions utilized a hippocampal-striatal functional connection, whereas non-memory influenced decisions did not. 

Dr. Shohamy's lecture was enjoyable and clear. Through creative experiments she found the striatumas and the hippocampu work together to influence decisions. She presented a series of data using inventive tasks demonstrating functional connectivity between these two regions was strong when a decision integrated information in a relational sense.

This finding is particularly interesting as the striatum traditionally is thought necessary for determining an 'average value' via habit formation and incremental learning. Whereas the hippocampus is known for a specific episodic focus as well as flexibility in memory. These two seem like opposing qualities. However they come together when tasks require integrating learned information as needed in relational memory.
